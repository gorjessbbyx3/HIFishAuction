Fish Price & Auction Data Sources

1. Honolulu Retail Monitoring Fish Price Data Collection (2016)
	•	What it is: Weekly consumer-level fish price data from Honolulu retail markets, covering species, product form, origin, and preservation details. Available in CSV format.
	•	Access via: NOAA’s InPort catalog or Data.gov export link.
	•	Why useful: Great for modeling retail price trends and seasonal baselines.
	•	￼ ￼

2. UFA Auction Sampling Data (1984–2002)
	•	What it is: Landing quantities and price-per-pound data from the United Fishing Agency (Honolulu Fish Auction), collected frequently (up to six times weekly).
	•	Access via: NOAA’s InPort (requires contacting NOAA; may involve confidentiality constraints).
	•	Why useful: Offers historical supply-side auction data to link volume with price.
	•	￼

3. WPacFIN Purchase Reports & Creel Surveys (WPacFIN, NOAA)
	•	What it is: Vendor purchase reports (first-sales figures by fishermen) and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from creel surveys.
	•	Access via: Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center’s WPacFIN data collections (public summaries).
	•	Why useful: Offers insights into supply patterns and fishing effort trends.
	•	￼

4. Pelagic Fisheries Market Analysis (2022)
	•	What it is: NOAA Technical Memorandum summarizing pelagic fishery data: landings, exports/imports, volume/value breakdowns.
	•	Access via: NOAA repository.
	•	Why useful: Provides aggregated context and benchmarks for Hawaiʻi’s main commercial species.

Weather & Storm Data Sources

1. NOAA NWS API (weather.gov)
	•	What it is: A free, programmatic API providing weather forecasts, observations, and, critically, warnings/alerts (e.g., storm watches).
	•	Access via: https://api.weather.gov endpoints.
	•	Why useful: To detect storm events and flag when fishing might be disrupted.
	•	￼

2. NCEI Storm Events Database
	•	What it is: A database of historic storm and severe weather events across the U.S., including Hawaiʻi.
	•	Access via: NOAA NCEI Storm Events page (bulk CSV download).
	•	Why useful: To label past storm disruptions and identify patterns in auction price spikes.
	•	￼

3. Hawaiʻi Mesonet (University of Hawaiʻi)
	•	What it is: A dense network (~100 stations statewide) offering real-time and archived data (every 15 minutes)—rainfall, wind, wave, etc.
	•	Access via: Hawaiʻi Climate Data Portal or Mesonet API.
	•	Why useful: Granular local weather inputs—including sudden storms at specific ports.
	•	￼ ￼

4. WFO Honolulu RSS Feeds
